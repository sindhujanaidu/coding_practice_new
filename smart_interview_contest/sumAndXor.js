Sum and XOR
Given a integer N, find the number of positive integers X such that X<=N and N+X = N^X (N xor X).

Input
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by T lines, each line contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print the count of X's, separated by new line.

Constraints
20 points
1 <= T <= 103
0 <= N <= 103

80 points
1 <= T <= 104
0 <= N <= 1018
