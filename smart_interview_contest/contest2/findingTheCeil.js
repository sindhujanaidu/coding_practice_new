/*
Finding the Ceil
Given an array, you have to find the ceil of a number x. The ceil of a number x is nothing but the smallest number in the array greater than or equal to x.


Input Format

The first line of input contains the N-size of the array. The next line contains N integers, the elements of the array. The next line contains Q - number of queries. 
Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer X, for which you have to find the ceil of X in the given array.

Output Format
For each query, print the ceil of X, separated by a new line. If ceil is not found, print the value of "INT_MAX
